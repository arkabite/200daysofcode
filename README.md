# 200 Days to Dev Excellence 🚀
Start Date:06/02/2026

## Overview

A comprehensive 200-day learning journey designed to transform into a skilled developer and software engineer. This repository logs daily progress across data structures, algorithms, and system design—both high-level architecture and low-level implementation details.

**Goal**: Master core CS fundamentals and land a solid developer role. UwU

## Objectives

- 📚 **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Build a strong foundation in fundamental data structures and algorithmic problem-solving
- 🏗️ **System Design (High-Level)**: Understand distributed systems, scalability, microservices, and architectural patterns
- ⚙️ **System Design (Low-Level)**: Learn about memory management, concurrency, OS concepts, and performance optimization
- 💼 **Interview Readiness**: Prepare comprehensively for technical interviews and real-world coding challenges
- 🎯 **Career Growth**: Develop industry-ready skills to successfully secure a developer position
